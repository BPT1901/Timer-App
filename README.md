As part of a practical progression with my Python learning I want to develop a simple timer that I can start and pause as I work through exercises in the MOOC FI Python course I am doing. Each time I start a particular exercise in a ‘Part’ of the mooc course I will start the timer and when I have finished for the day I will pause the timer. This will continue through all exercises in each part of the course. At the end of each part I will have a ‘stop’ function in the timer which will calculate the total amount of time I spent on that part of the course.
I want to develop this for 2 reasons. The first being a practical application using python knowledge in methods that I have already learnt and to be a break from just learning the exercises in the course. I feel I learn better when theory is combined with prac. The second reason is that I would actually like to know an accumulation of how many hours I spend on the course. At the end of each part it asks you how long did you spend.
